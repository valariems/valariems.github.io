    <p>While working at a fintech company, I introduced SUS scoring when heuristic evaluation and usability study results weren't enough to prove the need to overhaul a legacy UI to a modern design.</p>

          The problem
        </h3>
        <p>Although previous usability studies proved that a legacy UI needed an update to improve the user experience and reduce user frustration, decision makers were not prioritizing the necessary development work.</p>

          The solution
        </h3>
        <p>Run a usability study incorporating SUS scoring to prove the hypothesis that a redesign of a legacy user interface would move usability and user satisfaction from poor to delightful.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>Earlier usability studies had confirmed that a heavily used section of the application was challenging and frustrating for users, but the problems could easily be overcome with a user-centered approach to page and navigation redesign.</p>
    <p>I acted as mentor and design director to my junior UX designer as she built Axure prototypes that incorporated the patterns that I introduced into our design system after previously successful usability tests.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>We designed a study to present each version of the list view to 12 current customers, rotating versions to account for order bias. Users were asked to complete several tasks, each dealing with finding a specific item or group of items in the list, as well as rearranging and hiding  columns in the table.</p>
    <p>After completing&mdash;or attempting to complete&mdash;the tasks in one of the two versions, the user was asked to provide feedback via the SUS questionnaire, which they filled out privately. The user was then presented with the alternate page version, worked through the tasks, and again filled out the SUS questionnaire.</p>

    <p>The average SUS score for the legacy design was the equivalent of a "D" letter grade, and ranking in the bottom 20% of established standards.</p>
    <p>The average SUS score for the new design was well above our goal of 80, a solid "A", and ranking in the top 10% of established standards.</p>
