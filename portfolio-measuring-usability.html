    <p>While working at a fintech company, I introduced SUS scoring when heuristic evaluation and usability study results weren't enough to prove the need to overhaul a legacy UI to a modern design.</p>

          The problem
        </h3>
        <p>Although previous usability studies proved that a legacy UI needed an update to improve the user experience and reduce user frustration, decision makers were not prioritizing the necessary development work.</p>

          The solution
        </h3>
        <p>Run a usability study incorporating SUS scoring to prove the hypothesis that a redesign of a legacy user interface would move usability and user satisfaction from poor to delightful.</p>

    <p class="text-left">Earlier usability studies had confirmed that a heavily used section of the fintech web application was challenging and frustrating for users, but the problems could easily be overcome with a user-centered approach to page and navigation redesign.</p>
    <p>I acted as mentor and design director to my junior UX designer as she built Axure prototypes for use in a study to prove that a redesign would increase usability. The prototypes incorporated patterns that were incorporated into our design system being proven successful in usability studies.</p>

    </h3>
    <p class="case-study-centered">We designed a study to present each version of the Action Plan list view to 12 current customers, rotating versions to account for order bias. Users were asked to complete 4-5 tasks, each dealing with finding a specific action plan or group of action plans, as well as rearranging and hiding  columns in the list table.</p>
    <p>After completing&emdash;or attempting to complete&emdash;the tasks in one of the two versions, the user was asked to provide feedback via the SUS questionnaire, which they filled out privately. The user was then presented with the alternate page version, worked through the tasks, and again filled out the SUS questionnaire.</p>
