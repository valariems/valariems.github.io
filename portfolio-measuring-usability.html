    <p>While working at a fintech company, I introduced SUS scoring when heuristic evaluation and usability study results weren't enough to prove the need to overhaul a legacy UI to a modern design.</p>

          The problem
        </h3>
        <p>Although previous usability studies proved that a legacy UI needed an update to improve the user experience and reduce user frustration, decision makers were not prioritizing the necessary development work.</p>

          The solution
        </h3>
        <p>Run a usability study incorporating SUS scoring to prove the hypothesis that a redesign of a legacy user interface would move usability and user satisfaction from poor to delightful.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>Earlier usability studies had confirmed that a heavily used section of the application was challenging and frustrating for users, but the problems could easily be overcome with a user-centered approach to page and navigation redesign.</p>
    <p>I acted as mentor and design director to my junior UX designer as she built Axure prototypes that incorporated the patterns that I introduced into our design system after previously successful usability tests.</p>

      The usability study
      <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-left"></i>
    </h3>
    <p>We designed a study to present each version of the list view to 12 current customers, rotating versions to account for order bias. Users were asked to complete several tasks, each dealing with finding a specific item or group of items in the list, as well as rearranging and hiding  columns in the table.</p>
    <p>After completing&mdash;or attempting to complete&mdash;the tasks in one of the two versions, the user was asked to provide feedback via the SUS questionnaire, which they filled out privately. The user was then presented with the alternate page version, worked through the tasks, and again filled out the SUS questionnaire.</p>

    <p>The average SUS score for the legacy design was the equivalent of a "D" letter grade, and ranking in the bottom 20% of established standards.</p>
    <p>The average SUS score for the new design was well above our goal of 80, a solid "A", and ranking in the top 10% of established standards.</p>

      Key takeaways
      <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-left"></i>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="mb-8">While previous usability studies had proven increases in task completion, efficiency, and user satisfaction, the calculated SUS scores and corresponding conversion to a quantitative statistic made previously qualitative data more clear to stakeholders and established solid benchmarks moving forward.</li>
      <li class="mb-8">SUS scores for new designs exceeded expectations. While a higher score than legacy design our hypothesis going in to the study, the high score was more suprising when the fact that prototypes with limited functionality and incomplete design was taken into consideration.</li>
      <li class="mb-8">We saw the documented bump in SUS scores for advanced users on a legacy design.</li>
      <li class="mb-8">The SUS scores were easy for stakeholders to comprehend. Product owners and managers were able to incorporate this data in business cases to support predicted outcomes like higher customer satisfaction and conversion of NPS detractors to promoters.</li>
