    <p>While working at a fintech company, I introduced SUS scoring when heuristic evaluation and usability study results weren't enough to prove the need to overhaul a legacy UI to a modern design.</p>

          The problem
        </h3>
        <p>Although previous usability studies proved that a legacy UI needed an update to improve the user experience and reduce user frustration, decision makers were not prioritizing the necessary development work.</p>

          The solution
        </h3>
        <p>Run a usability study incorporating SUS scoring to prove the hypothesis that a redesign of a legacy user interface would move usability and user satisfaction from poor to delightful.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>Earlier usability studies had confirmed that a heavily used section of the application was challenging and frustrating for users, but the problems could easily be overcome with a user-centered approach to page and navigation redesign.</p>
    <p>I acted as mentor and design director to my junior UX designer as she built Axure prototypes to prepare for user testing. The prototypes incorporated design patterns that I introduced into our design system, which had been proven successful in previous user testing.</p>

      The usability study
      <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-left"></i>
    </h3>
    <p>We designed a study to present each version of the list view to 12 current customers, rotating versions to account for order bias. Users were asked to complete several tasks, each dealing with finding a specific item or group of items in the list, as well as rearranging and hiding  columns in the table.</p>
    <p>After completing&mdash;or attempting to complete&mdash;the tasks in one of the two versions, the user was asked to provide feedback via the SUS questionnaire, which they filled out privately. The user was then presented with the alternate page version, worked through the tasks, and again filled out the SUS questionnaire.</p>
    <p>I made the decision to test both versions with each user, rather than just one per user, because it gave me the opportunity to collect qualitative user feedback on the benefits and drawbacks of each design. When we made final scoring calculations, we ran numbers looking at the testing two ways â€” only using the score from the first version a user saw, versus using both scores from each individual user. We found no statistically significant difference in the calculated scores using only the first version seen by the user, or both versions seen by the user.

    <p>The average SUS score for the legacy design was the equivalent of a "D" letter grade, and ranking in the bottom 20% of established standards.</p>
    <p>The average SUS score for the new design was well above our goal of 80, a solid "A", and ranking in the top 10% of established standards.</p>
    <p>Our visual depiction of scoring results included a breakdown of each user's self-reported experience level with the current software.</p>

      Key takeaways
      <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-left"></i>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="mb-8">While previous usability studies of the new designs had proven increases in task completion, efficiency, and user satisfaction, the calculated SUS scores and corresponding conversion to a quantitative statistic made previously qualitative data very clear to stakeholders.</li>
      <li class="mb-8">Product owners and managers were able to incorporate this data into business cases to support predicted outcomes like higher customer satisfaction and conversion of NPS detractors to promoters.</li>
      <li class="mb-8">SUS scores for new designs exceeded expectations. While our hypothesis going was that SUS scores for the new experience would be higher the legacy experience, we did not expect our prototypes with limited functionality and incomplete design to surpass our future goal of 80 when actual development is completed.</li>
