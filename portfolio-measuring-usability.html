  <div class="wrapper">
    <p>While working at a fintech company, I introduced SUS scoring when heuristic evaluation and usability study results weren't enough to prove the need to overhaul a legacy UI to a modern design.</p>

          The problem
        </h3>
        <p>Although previous usability studies proved that a legacy UI needed an update to improve the user experience and reduce user frustration, decision makers were not prioritizing the necessary development work.</p>

          The solution
        </h3>
        <p>Run a usability study incorporating SUS scoring to prove the hypothesis that a redesign of a legacy user interface would move usability and user satisfaction from poor to delightful.</p>

    </h3>
    <p class="text-left">Earlier usability studies had confirmed that a heavily used section of the fintech web application was challenging and frustrating for users, but the problems could easily be overcome with a user-centered approach to page and navigation redesign.</p>
    <p>I acted as mentor and design director to my junior UX designer as she built Axure prototypes for use in a study to prove that a redesign would increase usability. The prototypes incorporated previously tested page layouts that had since been incorporated into our design system.</p>

    <p class="case-study-centered">When the design was finalized after team review of clickable prototypes, it was handed off to talented developers who built the infinitely scrolling page content in javascript.</p>
