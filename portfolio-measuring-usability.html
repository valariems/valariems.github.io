          The problem
        </h3>
        <p>Although previous usability studies proved that a legacy UI needed an update to improve the user experience and reduce user frustration, decision makers were not prioritizing the necessary development work.</p>

          The solution
        </h3>
        <p>Run a usability study incorporating SUS scoring to prove the hypothesis that a redesign of a legacy user interface would move usability and user satisfaction from poor to delightful.</p>

    <p class="case-study-centered">After thorough research of other sites used by our audience, I made the decision to feature organization profile photos. Hover cards would allow additional information to be presented about an organization&mdash;like its next upcoming event&mdash;without cluttering or distracting from the primary page information.</p>
