    <p>The marketing site for AllPlayers.com needed a design update during my time there from 2010-2012. Goals of the new design included effectively telling visitors who the application was form, what it could do for them, what benefits it provided, and easy links to sign up from every page.</p>

        <p>Users were running into roadblocks trying to use a very popular but dated tool in the OrgSync web application. Feature requests and support tickets were growing steadily.</p>

        <p>Development time was slated to rework the tool from the ground up, to make the tool easy to use and learn, while meeting the needs of a variety of users.</p>

    <p style="width: 45%;">
      We knew, from months if not years of customer feedback, the general desires of our users. It was time to take a comprehensive look at prior feedback from support tickets and idea board requests, and expand on it through customer interviews, heuristic evaluations, and data research. The result was a comprehensive list of over 50 wants and needs that the new tool needed to achieve for a successful redesign.
