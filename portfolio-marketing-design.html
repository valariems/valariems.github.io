    <p>The marketing site for AllPlayers.com needed a makeover during my time there from 2010-2012. Goals of the new design included effectively telling visitors what the product does, who it is for, what benefits it provides, and links to sign up for free.</p>

    <p>While I was not involved in the creation of the original home page, it was clear that the layout of this home page was intentially designed to be similar to Facebook's home page. Unlike visitors to Facebook, however, visitors to this page likely do not know what AllPlayers.com does or why they should use it.<p>

      My background in graphic design enables me to follow design principles that I often see overlooked in today's websites and applications.

      While CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation are valuable bases for site and application design, they don't (and can't) take basic design concepts into account. Using line lengths to keep text blocks readable, or designing type to help the reader scan a page for important ideas, or implementing white space effectively, are a designer's responsibility.

          <strong>Font choices</strong><br>
          The PT Sans font family was chosen for headlines for a number of reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Several weight and width options were available.</li>
          <li>A condensed font is a great choice for headlines thanks to its space-saving capabilities.</li>
          <li>The tall x-height feels friendly.</li>
          <li>The font plays nicely with the sans serif Helvetica body font.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    <p class="callout">
      Bold font weights were thoughtfully applied to allow users to scan the text find what was important to them.
