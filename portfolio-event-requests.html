    <p>While at OrgSync during 2014-2015, I redesigned a complex process used by universities to review and approve events run by student organizations. From initial exploration of the problem and goals, through prototypes to hand off to development, this feature upgrade was widely regarded as one of the top successes that the platform had seen.</p>

          The problem
        </h3>
        <p>Users were running into roadblocks trying to use a very popular but dated tool in the OrgSync web application. Feature requests and support tickets were growing steadily.</p>

          The solution
        </h3>
        <p>Development time was slated to rework the tool from the ground up, to make the tool easy to use and learn, while meeting the needs of a variety of users.</p>

    <p class="case-study-centered">This tool would be used by vastly different personas with different interests and goals. Defining these users, who we knew very well and heard from often, allowed us to keep them in the forefront of the design process and ensure that we met their needs.</p>
