    <p>While at OrgSync during 2014-2015, I redesigned a complex process used by universities to review and approve events run by student organizations. From initial exploration of the problem and goals, through prototypes to hand off to development, this feature upgrade was widely regarded as one of the top successes that the platform had seen.</p>

          The problem

        <p>Users were running into roadblocks trying to use a very popular but dated tool in the OrgSync web application. Feature requests and support tickets were growing steadily.</p>

        <p>Development time was slated to rework the tool from the ground up, to make the tool easy to use and learn, while meeting the needs of a variety of users.</p>

      <p>We knew, from months if not years of customer feedback, the general desires of our users. It was time to take a comprehensive look at prior feedback from support tickets and idea board requests, and expand on it through customer interviews, heuristic evaluations, and data research. The result was a comprehensive list of over 50 wants and needs that the new tool needed to achieve for a successful redesign.</p>

    <p class="case-study-centered">I developed use cases for a variety of involved users and scenarios. Care was taken to include actions (or lack thereof) that could throw roadblocks into the event approval process. At the same time, I converted the user flows to wireframes, using Keynote for this project, to depict what users would see when they attempted a task.</p>

      Development and iteration

    </h3>
    <p class="case-study-centered">Because of the complexity of this new feature (remember the 50+ user wants?), we reviewed this both internally with multiple teams&mdash;UX/UI, development, customer success, and leadership&mdash;and with actual customers. Multiple iterations were designed to simplify the complexity and test ideas against each other. The significant project scope also necessitated constant communication between design and development to adjust concepts as needed during production.</p>
