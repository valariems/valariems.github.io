    <p>While at OrgSync during 2014-2015, I redesigned a complex process used by universities to review and approve events run by student organizations. From initial exploration of the problem and goals, through prototypes to hand off to development, this feature upgrade was widely regarded as one of the top successes that the platform had seen.</p>

        <p>Development time was slated to rework the tool from the ground up, to make the tool easy to use and learn, while meeting the needs of a variety of users.</p>

    <p class="case-study-centered">After thorough research of other sites used by our audience, I made the decision to feature organization profile photos. Hover cards would allow additional information to be presented about an organization&mdash;like its next upcoming event&mdash;without cluttering or distracting from the primary page information.</p>
