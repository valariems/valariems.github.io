When I started redesigning this site, I had a vision. My home page would be a feed of my Dribbble shots instead of the animated story I was previously using. I'd keep the same structure as before: home, about, resume, portfolio, and contact page. I'd just bring the site into 2016 with full-screen images and a clean look.

Since this was a very informal project, and I was my own client, I started design directly in the browser. I played around with some javascript that pulled the dribble feed onto the home page, then started tackling the About page. A block of grey text wasn't want I wanted. I started thinking about graphics or images I could use on the page. The idea of a puzzle option emerged, since in my content I start with the idea that solving problems in  a user interface starts like a puzzle.

I found a stock image that I fell in love with. It had two interlocking but mismatched puzzle pieces standing in the foreground, and a great depth-of-field thing going on. Bingo. This was gonna be awesome. Purchased.

I implemented it as a full-screen background image and kept going.

The next section in my personal story was about my move from a company in St. Louis to a freelance career in Dallas. I already owned photos of those skylines. Clear as day, I saw the two images with an airplane's path leading from one to the other. I created a graphic I liked that incorporated line art and a rocketship purchased from thenounproject.com. This was working. Photos with a touch of whimsy and unexpectedness.

But wait. Why was I delegating this nifty page that tells my story to a secondary page on the site? Could this make a more interesting home page than a Dribbble feed, which isn't exactly a unique idea?

Of course it could. So I switched gears. Kill the About page, and tell my story on the home page.

But darn it, as much as I wanted it to, that puzzle image just didn't have the personality that I thought it would. Time to think about alternatives. I headed back to fotolia.com and ran more images searches. Passion. Power. Oh hey, there it is. Boom. Little boy in cape holding a flower. This had style, personality, whimsy, a touch of abstraction, and the perfect composition to overlay text.

This is where the design came together. I could carry the line art theme from the city-rocketship section into this image, by replacing the photo's flower with line art.

I searched through other images from that same photographer, to see if the style could be extended to other sections on the page. Continuity is vital throughout a design, so other images in that same photographer's style would be ideal. Sure enough, there was a girl and a balloon. Click, click, buy, buy.

Reflecting back, the home page of this new site looks nothing like I originally envisioned. But that's a good thing. While a Dribbble feed would showcase snippets of work, it's mundane. There's already a link to my Dribbble shots elsewhere on the site, so visitors can still see them. They may also wind up in a portfolio section at a later date.

It's easy to get stuck on the first solution that comes to mind when developing a new design. Sometimes a first idea is the best one. Often, it's just not.

In college design classes, students are tasked with sketching out 10, 50, even 100 thumbnails on an assignment. There's a good reason for that. Ideas evolve, and one idea leads to another, which leads to another, and so on.

Let the ideas lead you where they want to go. My first solution wasn't my best solution. Where I am today still may not be the best solution. But at some point, you have to build it. You have to ship it.

Show it off, gather feedback, look at it another day. Lather, rinse, repeat.
