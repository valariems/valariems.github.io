After a few hours of composing content for Jekyll using Markdown, I had a problem that needed to be solved. At that point, I wanted to revert to HTML just for the indents and syntax highlighting that offered visual clues to my typographical hierarchy.

In [How to Set Up Sublime Text for a Vastly Better Markdown Writing Experience](https://blog.mariusschulz.com/2014/12/16/how-to-set-up-sublime-text-for-a-vastly-better-markdown-writing-experience/ "How to Set Up Sublime Text for a Vastly Better Markdown Writing Experience"), Marius Schultz recommends the [Monokai Extended](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-monokai-extended "Monokai Extended on Github") package.

Ah, that helps. "Vastly better" might be an overstatement---I wish I could easily differentiate my h1s from my h3s---but it's a start. I'm open to other suggestions.
