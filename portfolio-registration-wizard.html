    <p>AllPlayers.com needed to gather information from users to improve their site experience and prevent user frustration. Gathering this information during new account registration was shown to be a blocker to onboarding customers.</p>

      The Challenge
      <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-left"></i>
    </h3>
    <div class="case-study-centered">
      The company needed to collect time zone and phone number from users to deliver accurate information to users, and also had to verify birth dates for COPPA compliance. Users were understandably hesitant to provide this information during account creation, and sometimes abandoned registration rather than answer.

    <div class="case-study-centered">
      We had to satisfy company requirements to gather this information, while quickly and succinctly explaining the value of providing this information to the user.

      The Solution

    </h3>
    <div class="case-study-centered">
      Discontinue asking users to provide information they feel is unnecessary or don't understand while creating a new account. Make these asks part of a new user onboarding wizard when the user completes the simpler account creation process.

      A friendly wizard modal asked users the necessary questions in a friendly manner, briefly explained the ask while allaying their concers, and provided the opportunity to cancel the process. Positional feedback showed them the short process, and their progress.

      This design was created several years ago, before I was familiar with accessibility guidelines. While the changes made here were a success from the standpoint of solving a business and user problem, they clearly fail when viewed through the lens of accessible color palettes. The gold buttons were part of the site color palette when I joined the organization, and it wasn't until later that we shifted the color palette to incorporate blue as a button color.
