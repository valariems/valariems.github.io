Here's some nuggets I've found about UI, UX, design and development that I'll want to revisit and share.

"It was like the programmers just barfed the database onto the screen."

#####Jared Spool, [User Interface Engineering](https://www.uie.com/ "User Interface Engineering")



###[The Dribbblisation of Design](https://blog.intercom.io/the-dribbblisation-of-design/ "The Dribbblisation of Design")

"If product design is about solving problems for people within the constraints of a specific business, then it simply feels that many people calling themselves product/UX designers are actually practicing digital art."

#####Paul Adams, [Intercom](https://www.intercom.io/ "Intercom")



###[UI Pattern: Natural Language Form](http://www.jroehm.com/2014/01/ui-pattern-natural-language-form/ "UI Pattern: Natural Language Form")

"It’s easy to see how a sentence, written in natural language, is more engaging than a traditional form. For one because it’s a novel concept and this fact alone sparks interest. More importantly however, a natural language form reflects the mental model of a user better than a traditional form."
